## General concepts

### [disease diffusion mapping (Q5282121)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5282121)
Disease diffusion occurs when a disease is transmitted to a new location. It implies that a disease spreads, or pours out, from a central source.

### [disease ecology (Q60703450)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60703450)
Disease ecology is a sub-discipline of ecology concerned with the mechanisms, patterns, and effects of host-pathogen interactions, particularly those of infectious diseases

### [health geography (Q3286542)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3286542)
Health geography is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of health, disease, and health care.

### [reverse zoonosis (Q1049711)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1049711)
A reverse zoonosis, also known as a zooanthroponosis (Greek zoon "animal", anthropos "man", nosos "disease") or anthroponosis, is a pathogen reservoired in humans that is capable of being transmitted to non-human animals.

### [spatial epidemiology (Q7574064)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7574064)
Spatial epidemiology is a subfield of epidemiology focused on the study of the spatial distribution of health outcomes; it is closely related to health geography.

### [synthetic data (Q7662746)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7662746)
Synthetic data is any production data applicable to a given situation that are not obtained by direct measurement

### [Tobler's first law of geography (Q3436744)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3436744)
the principle that, even though everything relates to everything else, nearby things are more related than distant things

### [zoonosis (Q182672)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q182672)
A zoonosis or zoonotic disease is an infectious disease of humans caused by a pathogen (an infectious agent, such as a bacterium, virus, parasite or prion) that has jumped from an animal (usually a vertebrate) to a human.
