## General concepts

### Disease diffusion (Q5282121)
> _Disease diffusion occurs when a disease is transmitted to a new location.[1] It implies that a disease spreads, or pours out, from a central source._ - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_diffusion_mapping

### Disease ecology (Q60703450)
> _Disease ecology is a sub-discipline of ecology concerned with the mechanisms, patterns, and effects of host-pathogen interactions, particularly those of infectious diseases._ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_ecology

### Health geography (Q3286542)

> _Health geography is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of health, disease, and health care._ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_geography

### Reverse zoonosis (Q1049711)
> _A reverse zoonosis, also known as a zooanthroponosis (Greek zoon "animal", anthropos "man", nosos "disease") or anthroponosis,[1] is a pathogen reservoired in humans that is capable of being transmitted to non-human animals._ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_zoonosis

### Spatial epidemiology (Q7574064)
> _Spatial epidemiology is a subfield of epidemiology focused on the study of the spatial distribution of health outcomes; it is closely related to health geography. Specifically, spatial epidemiology is concerned with the description and examination of disease and its geographic variations. This is done in consideration of â€œdemographic, environmental, behavioral, socioeconomic, genetic, and infections risk factors._ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_epidemiology

### Synthetic data (Q7662746)

> _Synthetic data is "any production data applicable to a given situation that are not obtained by direct measurement" according to the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms;[1] where Craig S. Mullins, an expert in data management, defines production data as "information that is persistently stored and used by professionals to conduct business processes."_ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_data

### Tobler's first law of geography
> _"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."_ -- [Tobler's first law of geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler%27s_first_law_of_geography)

### Zoonosis (Q182672)
> _A zoonosis or zoonotic disease is an infectious disease of humans caused by a pathogen (an infectious agent, such as a bacterium, virus, parasite or prion) that has jumped from an animal (usually a vertebrate) to a human._ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis
