| Q5282121           | disease diffusion mapping    | Disease diffusion occurs when a disease is transmitted to a new location. It implies that a disease spreads, or pours out, from a central source. |

### Disease diffusion (Q5282121)

> *Disease diffusion occurs when a disease is transmitted to a new
> location.\[1\] It implies that a disease spreads, or pours out, from a
> central source.* -
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_diffusion_mapping>

### Disease ecology (Q60703450)

> *Disease ecology is a sub-discipline of ecology concerned with the
> mechanisms, patterns, and effects of host-pathogen interactions,
> particularly those of infectious diseases.* –
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_ecology>

### Health geography (Q3286542)

> *Health geography is the application of geographical information,
> perspectives, and methods to the study of health, disease, and health
> care.* – <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_geography>

### Reverse zoonosis (Q1049711)

> *A reverse zoonosis, also known as a zooanthroponosis (Greek zoon
> “animal”, anthropos “man”, nosos “disease”) or anthroponosis,\[1\]
> is a pathogen reservoired in humans that is capable of being
> transmitted to non-human animals.* –
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_zoonosis>

### Spatial epidemiology (Q7574064)

> *Spatial epidemiology is a subfield of epidemiology focused on the
> study of the spatial distribution of health outcomes; it is closely
> related to health geography. Specifically, spatial epidemiology is
> concerned with the description and examination of disease and its
> geographic variations. This is done in consideration of “demographic,
> environmental, behavioral, socioeconomic, genetic, and infections risk
> factors.* – <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_epidemiology>

### Synthetic data (Q7662746)

> *Synthetic data is “any production data applicable to a given
> situation that are not obtained by direct measurement” according to
> the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms;\[1\]
> where Craig S. Mullins, an expert in data management, defines
> production data as "\`information that is persistently stored and used
> by professionals to conduct business processes.\`"* –
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_data>

### Tobler’s first law of geography

> *"\`Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more
> related than distant things.\`"* – [Tobler’s first law of
> geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler%27s_first_law_of_geography)

### Zoonosis (Q182672)

> *A zoonosis or zoonotic disease is an infectious disease of humans
> caused by a pathogen (an infectious agent, such as a bacterium, virus,
> parasite or prion) that has jumped from an animal (usually a
> vertebrate) to a human.* – <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis>
